I am a 26 years old PhD student at the university of Oslo and Wageningen University. 
My scientific background lays in limnology and marine biology. The collapse of fish and fisheries
is of special interest for me. My research is highly interdisciplinary, combining biological and socio-economic elements in a modeling framework.
In my free time I like reading books and horse riding.
